# Image Quantization using Pillow

This project demonstrates the use of the Pillow library in Python for applying image quantization techniques. The code imports an image, applies quantization to reduce its color palette, and compares the quantized image with the original image.


2. Features:
- Load an image using Pillow.
- Apply image quantization to reduce the number of colors.
- Save and display the original and quantized images for comparison.


3. Tools Used
- Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
- TensorFlow / Keras: For building, training, and testing the CNN model.
- NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing training and evaluation metrics.
- scikit-learn: For additional tasks like train-test splitting and evaluation metrics.


4. Results
- The result is a side-by-side comparison of the original image with the quantized version. You may notice some loss of color detail, but the overall structure of the image remains intact.
